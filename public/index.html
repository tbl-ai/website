                    <p>We are developing multimodal artificial intelligence systems designed to collaborate with people,
                        prioritizing human-AI partnership over fully autonomous systems.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 2rem;">AI that works for everyone</h2>

                    <p style="margin: 0 0 1.5rem 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">Our work emphasizes
                        human-AI collaboration. Rather than focusing exclusively on fully autonomous artificial
                        intelligence systems, we are committed to developing multimodal systems that operate
                        collaboratively with people.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0 0 2rem 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">We are building more
                        flexible, adaptable, and personalized artificial intelligence systems. We recognize substantial
                        potential for artificial intelligence to contribute across every field of work. While
                        contemporary systems demonstrate excellence in programming and mathematics, we are developing AI
                        systems capable of adapting to the full spectrum of human expertise and enabling a broader range
                        of applications.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Our approach</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">We maintain that the
                        most effective artificial intelligence systems are those that augment human capabilities rather
                        than replace them. Our focus centers on creating tools that comprehend context, adapt to
                        individual requirements, and operate seamlessly alongside people in their professional and
                        personal endeavors.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Learning by doing</h2>

                    <h3>Research and product co-design</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 2rem 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">Products facilitate
                        iterative learning through deployment, while exceptional products and research mutually
                        reinforce one another. Products maintain our connection to practical reality and direct us
                        toward solving the most impactful problems.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Measure what truly matters</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 2rem 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">We will focus on
                        understanding how our systems generate genuine value in real-world contexts. The most
                        significant breakthroughs frequently emerge from rethinking our objectives, rather than merely
                        optimizing existing metrics.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Empirical and iterative approach to AI safety</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 1rem 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">The most effective
                        safety measures emerge from a combination of proactive research and meticulous real-world
                        testing. We intend to contribute to artificial intelligence safety through the following
                        approaches:</p>
                    <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 1.5rem 1.1rem; color: var(--text-muted); display: grid; gap: 0.6rem;">
                        <li><strong>Maintaining a high safety standard</strong> – preventing misuse of our released
                            models while maximizing user freedom</li>
                        <li><strong>Sharing best practices</strong> – methodologies for building safe artificial
                            intelligence systems with the industry</li>
                        <li><strong>Accelerating external research</strong> – on alignment through sharing code,
                            datasets, and model specifications</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin: 0 0 2rem 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">We maintain that methods
                        developed for contemporary systems, including effective red-teaming and post-deployment
                        monitoring, provide valuable insights that will extend to future, more capable systems.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Our philosophy</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 0; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.6;">By integrating
                        rigorous research with real-world deployment, we establish a feedback mechanism that
                        continuously enhances both our comprehension of artificial intelligence capabilities and our
                        capacity to develop safer, more effective systems.</p>
